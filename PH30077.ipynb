    "This purpose of this notebook is to create a folder to use for your work on the Module PH30077: Electromagnetism 2.  Don't worry if you have not used Jupyter notebooks before, the lectures and material provided for your course will guide you.  Use of the Jupyter notebooks is non-examinable but I hope it will enhance your understanding of the core material.\n",

    "For now select the cell below and run the cell by pressing the `Run` button in the toolbar above.  This will create a folder in your home directory and make a copy of any resources you will need.  When this has run successfully the text to the left of the will change from `In [ ]` to `In [1]`.  You can then close this tab and open the `PH30077` folder in your home directory to get started.\n",
    "\n",
    "I will add further notebooks as we progress through the course.  You can re-run this script to copy the new notebooks into your folder."
