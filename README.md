# Electromagnetism simulations
This repository holds a collection of notebooks that I produced while teaching Electromagnetism 2 at Bath University.  They include some basic simulations that I hope are useful to students learning about electromagnetic radiation.

You may or may not be able to view the notebooks on GitHub.  If you can't, the quickest way is to use Google Colab.  You can do this with URLs that look like:

```
https://colab.research.google.com/github/rwb27/PH30077/blob/master/Wavetank.ipynb
```

Substitute `Wavetank.ipynb` for the name of the notebook you want to run.  It will copy it over, render it, and even let you run it (if you sign in).  If you prefer not to let Google see your data, you'll just need a local Jupyter server, and you can download or clone this repository to your own computer.  Pull requests with improvements and extensions welcome, though I probably won't have time to accept anything until after the end of term!

For ease of clicking, here are some individual Colab links:
